        - Tap to Call
        - Some Insights From Our Customers
        - Conclusions
- Why Aren't People Doing It?
    - It's Hard
        - Buying numbers takes forever and doesn't scale well
        - Logging is usually locked up behind some black box, inaccessible and
          often inaccurate
        - Tracking / recording multiple legs of the same call was expensive and
          often didn't work
    - It's Inflexible
        - The usual tools we use on the web for optimizing funnels like A/B
          testing are usually technically impossible on IVRs
        - Warm transfers to external partners / call centers are ridiculously
          difficult
        - Add / remove / change is a line item on a consulting contract
    - It's Slow
        - Hundreds of numbers takes weeks, thousands of numbers is months if at
          all
        - Measurement requires interfacing with multiple systems - reporting
          requires head count to collate all this stuff together
        - Devs for phone systems are specialists and hard to find - you can't
          use the technical staff you already have
    - It's Out of Reach for most of us
        - Huge capex for buying the gear yourself
        - Hardware-based vendors kill your margin
        - Both usually come with serious commitments
- How The Cloud Can Help
    - Cloud company
        - The term is a bit of a victim of its own success
        - My ma has heard of it, but there are a lot of times when even I don't
          know what it means.
        - Turns big infrastructure into something you pay for like your electricity
    - How It Works
        - Numbers sit in the cloud
        - Calls or texts come in, Twilio makes a request to your web application
        - You respond with some simple XML
        - That XML contains the instructions on what to do with the call
        - Everything "just works"
    - Why Any Of That Matters
        - Your web people become telephone people
        - Helper libraries means they don't learn anything fundamentally new
        - You finally get to apply all the stuff we've learned about leadgen on
          the web to the higher conversion, greater impact medium of telephony

                - CTA is important
            - Get enough phone numbers - but not too many
                - Granularity is a tough thing to gauge
                - You don't need for every keyword or offline location, you need for every group of
                  ads
            - Record calls
                - Only way you can improve service

              would give me their phone number?
        - Tap to Call
            - Button on the interface that is driving the consumer interest
            - Click it and they are connected instantly - browser or native
              mobile app
        - Show How It Works
        - Uses
            - Contextual information while talking to the lead
            - Display delivery menu while on the phone with the restaurant
            - Color picker while talking to a retail store
            - While you are talking on the phone with Internet manager at a
              dealership, get a pin drop with location of the car you're looking
              at and a live rep to give you a hand.
    - More Pro Tips
        - Score Your Leads
            - Call volume is not a super indicator
            - Call time == engagement
            - Ratio of long / short calls
            - Quanitative - Revenue
            - Qualitative - agent 1-2-3
        - Smart routing
            - Highest value lead sources should go to experience top performers
            - Whittling down to expected revenue to call is key to doing this
              well
            - Really gets the top performance out of your top performers
        - Logging
            - Calls should go to a CRM
            - Automated followup emails - look at open / click / bounce
            - Your revenue is realtime - so too should be your reporting
        - Whisper messages
            - Deliver as much crucial information to the agent as possible
            - Screen pops are great, but an audible intro is good as well
            - Forewarned is forearmed
        - Don't forget about SMS
            - You got five minutes to get ahold of the lead
            - If your agents are in the field or not technically inclined, SMS
              is a powerful agent
            - Faster, more reliable than email
- Conclusion
    - We're in a renaissance for the telephone
    - For all these new technologies that are changing the way we consume,
      people still prefer picking up the plain old telephone
    - However plain old telephone people are not going to serve this emerging
      need
    - Folks who apply online leadgen techniques to telephony have a market
      advantage that is difficult to beat
    - Almost as awesome as a time traveling, flying DeLorean
