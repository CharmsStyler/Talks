Learn Brogramming the Hard Way
#################################

A fifteen-minute comedy routine riffing on the Brogramming meme.  Performed as the uber-bro character "Chad," this presentation showcases a framework for improving oneself as a brogrammer called The Brotocol - Grok, Trunk and Live.
A one-time-only performance given at [Twilio Conference](http://www.twilio.com/conference), September 2011.  


Outline
---------------------------------

- Introduction
    - "Hold on - Windows is booting up."
    - "Rob couldn't make it tonight- He had a muni league Ultimate Frisbee tournament to go to.  Yeah, it's quarterfinals - it's pretty intense."
    - "I'm Rob's buddy Chad and I've basically been a brogrammer since before I could walk."
    - "Totally got started brogramming in PE class at Robert F. Kennedy Elementary in the Hamptons. Strong Island, bro, Strong Island."
    - "Someone left their Sony Vaio on the lacrosse field open to Visual Studio, and it wasn't long before I was ripping the dank code, impressing the shawties with my Friendster / Last.fm mashup running on VB."
    - "Some people weren't born a totally chill brosiah.  Some people just weren't born with the body that rocks the party.  Some people are just dudes."
    - "I was thinking about this when I was sitting in a Scrum meeting when the Product Owner turns to me and says this Requirement is now defined, and I'm like, 'Cool Story, bro - but how does that make me a better brogrammer?'"
    - "So I totally bailed on of the coworking conference couch we were renting, hopped into my Jeep Grand Cherokee and went straight to the gym to rage and think how a brogrammer can re-up his game so he can rep 24/7."    
- The Brotocol
    - Low-level code is for suckers.  If you're a real brogrammer, you use a framework.
    - In the immortal words of Brosef Stalin, "Dude, I'm way too faded to build this shiz. Imma have some other broheims do the grunge work. Totes magotes."
    - Presenting The Brotocol
    - A simple, easy-to-integrate framework for your brogramming lifestyle
    - A way to re-up your game every day and become a better brogrammer.
    - GTL - Grok, Trunk, Live 
- Grok
    - Definition
        - Solid brogrammers expand their knowledge base.
        - You want to be on top of your game, grok something new every day.
    - Tech
        - "The Pragmatic Brogrammer: From Townie to Totally Chill"
        - CLRSS 4th Ed: Coreman, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein and Steezy - The brototypical text on algorithmic design.  It's got some great stuff on integrating broroutines and complex shawty distribution maps.  Really helps in the club.
        - Resacktoring: Improving the Design of Existing Brode - Sometimes, some slump buster gets into your codebase and harshes your app."  
    - Bro Literature
	    - ("On the Bro'd" by Jack Kerouac)[http://onthebrod.com/] - "I first met Dean not long after Tryscha and I hooked up. I had just gotten over a wicked fucking hangover that I wonâ€™t bother to talk about, except that it had something to do with a six-foot-five douchebag and a beer bong."
	    - "Probie Dick" by Herdude Melville - a stunning descent into the obsessive depths of a sea-faring fraternity pledgemaster.
	    - My Life by Bill Clinton.  That bro gets the ladies.
- Trunk
    - Definition
        - Trunk is more than just the SVN directory where everyone on your 150 person project commits to HEAD, bro.
        - Trunking is a way of life; it's expanding the tools in your brogramming fanny pack to make you adapt to any situation.
    - Code
        - Datastore: SQL is for chumps, NoSQL is for posers, BroSQL is where it's at.  
        - BrongoDB is kinda my fave.
        - Messaging:  Bronado.  Used at Facebook, and you know those broskis can rage.
        - MVC: BrodeIgniter.  PHP, and a Twilio helper library.  Everything a bro needs!
    - Music
        - You can't rip on code with busted tunes.
        - You're saying, Chad - Jack Johnson all the way.
        - Listen Brobi Wan Kenobi, we're over it already.  It's all about dubstep now.
        - No talent eight bit electro is the new hippie jam band
        - Classical music is great when you're heads down ripping on a feature: Brohannes Brahms, Wolfgang Amadudeus Brozart, and Manheim Steamroller. 
        - Whitney Houston: What, bro?  It's for my girlfriend.
- Live
    - Definition
        - Work hard, play hard is, like, the brogrammer credo.
        - When you go out, you're not repping yourself, you're repping all of brokind.
        - Life is short; brogrammers live it up.
    - Gym
        - Don't bring work to the gym, bring your gym to work.
        - Fitness balls and grip exercises are weak.
        - Treadmill desk - cardio while you code.
        - Cisco products - Top-of-rack curls for your biceps, Cat 6k squats for the hardcore
        - 1-5 Rule for Meetings - One pushup for every five slides you see.
    - Party
       - You need to party hard to hang with the Twilio crew.  If you don't know, you're about to learn, bro.
       - Beer pong: Go big or go home.  If can't divide the total number of cups by twenty, you're at a scrub table.
       - Ice luges: Essential part of any quality brodown.  Make sure if you do it up, you live it up.
       - Drinking games: Write a crawlbot that does a case-insensitive regex for "shenanigans" and point it at twilio.com.  Take a shot of Grey Goose for every match.
- Conclusion
    - Conform to the brotocol and you're well on your way to a more steezy life
    - If you GTL every day, I can't guarantee you'll write better code, but I can guarantee you'll be a better brogrammer. 
    - btw - if you're a recruiter for Square, you can totally check out my Github.  Those dudes know how to brogram.
    - Peace out!
