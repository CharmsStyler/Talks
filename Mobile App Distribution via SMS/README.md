- Mobile App Distribution via SMS
    - Holy biscuits is this talk going to be a lot of fun.
    - If your game is mobile apps, I don't need to tell you how fragmented the
      space is.

      Twitter clients, browser capabilities, screen sizes and screen densities
      produce more overlaying concentric circles than an Irish wake.

      potential user of your mobile app.
    - 97% of all US consumers have phones that can receive SMS.
