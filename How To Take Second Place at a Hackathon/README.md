How To Take Second Place at a Hackathon
========================================

A fifteen minute pump-you-up talk on how to perform well at a hackathon,
codejam, buildoff, or startup weekend.  Tactical advice from a veteran of these
types of events on how focus, finish and place well in an intensive limited-time
creative competition. 



Outline
--------------------

- Intro
    - So, here you are
    - A sunny weekend in {{City}} and you are sacrificing sleep, sanity and your
      social life to the holy altar of enterprise and creativity in an intensive
      limited time competition
    - You're my kind of people
    - And as my kind of people, you hate to lose.
    - And why not?  Losing stinks like a bag of rotten hot dogs
    - You're here to bring the thunder, deliver the pain, and open up a can of
      code-driven whoopass and take home the gold
    - Well, this talk won't help you with that
    - This talk will help you take second place at a hackathon
    - This talk will help you get the most out of your hackathon experience and
      have a blast while building something you love
- Bio
    - Developer evangelist for Twilio
    - Technical background
    - Though there is some debate, the hackathon that started this craze was
      back in 2006 
    - Since then I've been to a whole bunch
    - And placed in quite a few
    - I've learned a few things about how to approach these things and am happy
      to share that experience with you
- First Place at a Hackathon
    - Wanna take first prize?
    - Easy - just cheat
        - Prepare something ahead of time
        - Bring in a ringer
        - Bribe the judges {{show their pictures}}
- Second Place at a Hackathon
    - Second place is a lot harder to win
    - Second place requires
        - Talent
        - Teamwork
        - Commitment
        - Luck
    - Second place requires all the ingredients that make a good startup
    - These types of competitions are great crucibles for forging the character
      of your company
- Real solutions for real hackathons
    - Well, thanks Rob.  Like we didn't know that
    - Here is some real tactical, pragmatic advice for participating in this
      event
    - Go With What You Know
        - Use only tools, techniques, technologies and frameworks with which you
          possess intimate familiarity
        - This advice goes equally for technical and non-technical team members
        - A competition like this is a poor environment to learn Django for the
          first time
        - Similarly, if you've been dying to do responsive design, you may want
          to wait for a different opportunity where the time limit is so
          extreme.  This will only be showing up on one laptop or mobile device
        - Not steeped in regression analysis?  Someone in the crowd is going to
          ask why you went with a linear regression instead of a nonparametric
          technique
        - Hackathons are not the place to "fake it til you make it"
    - Get to the Demo ASAP
        - You're not building a web service, you're not building a prototype of
          a web service, you're building a demo of a web service
        - You have two effective minutes to demonstrate this
        - Feature richness is not important here, feature quality is
        - Iteration is more important than a feature checklist
        - No demo == DNF
    - Avoid Common Technical Pitfalls 
        - Oauth
            - Only use it for a service you already have in production
            - None of them are the same - if you know Facebook and Twitter,
              you're a highly valuable resource
            - Apigee is a lifesaver here
        - Users
            - Put it off if you can
            - Pick a framework that has users built in (Django, Rails,
              Zend, Google App Engine)
            - Don't make your own users to satisfy a framework preference
              (Flask, Sinatra, CodeIgniter)
        - "Well, it was running on my laptop"
            - Pick your deployment option early
            - Heroku, dot Cloud, GAE great
            - EC2 is a bigger hassle, make sure you have experience
            - Deploy frequently with non-technical team members serving as
              testers
    - Remember the Goal
        - There should be two - and _only_ two - products of this weekend: your
          vision and your demo
        - Each should reinforce the other
        - Vision
            - Defined problem with a solution
            - Sell the philosophy, not the market or the model
            - The view with the naked eye, preferably lifted to the stars
            - Humor wins hackathons
        - Demo
            - Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
            - Do one thing - and _only_ one thing - well
            - That one thing should represent the obvious utility of that
              philosophy
            - Code freeze 9am day of the demo
            - Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse
        - Shit you should avoid
            - About page
            - Excel forecast
            - Name-dropping investors
            - Google Analytics graph
            - Intro videos *unless they are truly epic
- Conclusions
    - Boil down your weekend to five minutes of awesome without pause
    - Do one thing and do it well
    - Having fun is the best way to ensure success
    - And hey, if you lose, you're in pretty good company
