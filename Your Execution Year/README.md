- Description
    - What It Is
        - Growing, not building
        - Product / market fit should already be snug
        - The strategy is proven at small scale
        - Now executing on it is the paramount objective
    - What It Isn't
        - Pivot o' clock
        - Product identity is finished
        - You more or less have the tools you need to succeed
- Hire Like Hell
    - The inflection point
        - Your team now eclipses you in terms of impact
        - Leadership and vision are critical more than ever, but you can no longer
          accomplish your goals on force of will alone
    - Scaling is different than building
        - Team needs to look different
        - Specialists need to come in
        - Experience becomes a premium
    - Pro Tips
        - Attack recruiting with the same priority as engineering
            - Staff it appropriately
            - Optimize for the interview process 
            - Place it at paramount importance
            - The only thing more expensive than hiring a good developer is
              hiring a bad developer
        - Small teams with big responsibilities
            - Technical people love to ship
            - Product / feature level responsibility owned end-to-end
            - Give them full ownership - large QA teams == worse software
            - No matter what the methodology, they are shipping new code every
              two weeks
        - Make your culture the best product you ship 
            - Product-level investment
            - Work hard, play hard
            - Training - the 101 model
            - Everyone gets the product experience
        - Distance is lethal
            - Spectre Corollary - the number of bugs you ship is directly
              proportional to the distance in feet between your engineering and
              QA / Support organizations.
            - Embed QA onto engineering teams
            - Saying you don't have enough time for automated testing is saying
              you have enough time for making the same mistake over and over
- Sell at Scale
    - The part no one writes about
        - Wow - that Steve Jobs sure had a great conversion rate
        - Justin Timberlake comp plan for Facebook's advertising team sure was
          shrewd
        - Least appreciation in our line of work
    - Optmization here has the biggest effect on your bottom line
        - Cheapest win - executing well here is inexpensive in time and dollars
          compared to product, engineering, 
        - Shortest distance between a KPI percentage point and revenue growth
    - Pro tips
        - Comp plans == most important lever
            - Simple, predictable, and responsibly generous
            - Works in good times and bad, and scalable for your business
            - Consistency is rewarded over blowout quarters 
            - Get an experience hand to do this early - do *not* change it
        - One head of sales
            - Inside, outside and channel all report to the same person
            - That person is not the CEO
            - Most competitive group in your company - they should never be
              incented to compete against each other
        - Marketing is heavily ratio dependent
            - 2:1 engineering to marketing headcount
            - 60:40 program spend to people
            - 50:50 analytical and soft skills
            - Your PR has a shelf life - squeeze every drop you can out of this year
- Stay Hungry
    - It is easier to spend the next ten million than the first
    - Pro tips
        - Easy money savers
            - Save the miles - fly coach
            - Plug the leaks quarterly
            - Renegotiate unapologetically
        - Go Cloud-Powered
            - Seems a bit self-serving, but it's true
            - Find every opportunity to pay-as-you-go
            - Capex is the enemy
            - Every dollar in hardware is three in maintenance - Total Cost of
              Ownership is your new mantra
        - Spend smart
            - Developer time has succeeded the American dollar as the most
              precious resource a startup can have
            - Always invest in speeding up your engineering team - and I don't
              mean Aeron chairs.  Tools, gear, and great hardware.
            - Don't be gimmicky about comp
- Fail Fast, Often and Small
    - Learn from the cloud
        - One important architectural technique for distributed systems is the
          fast timeout
        - If contacting an external resource, your code should fail reasonably
          quickly and handle that failure gracefully
    - Same goes for your business
        - Limit scope and resources on new initiatives
        - Instrument everything with a feedback mechanism of some kind
        - Dispassionately ditch anything that doesn't drive huge growth -
          average performance is the enemy
    - Pro tips
        - Continuous Integration
            - Release small changes as often as possible
            - Keep the main development branch (aka master or trunk) in a
              releasable state
            - Easier on the web than on mobile devices
        - Beware the product re-arch / redesign
            - How many do you remember went well last year?
            - How many didn't?
            - Some guy who looks a lot like me is going to walk up to you, talk
              all about the benefits of a new programming language, datastore or
              other fundamental technology and say it'll take "about 3 months."
            - Everyone maligns PHP, but look at Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest
            - Programming language is one of the least important factors to
              scaling your architecture - focus on scaling your business
- Obsess over the Customer 
- Conclusions
    - Buy your 30th employee a beer.  He/she probably has a few insights your
      startup could use.
